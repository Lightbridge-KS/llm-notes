## Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS): A User's Guide

In 2017, the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) Committee of the American College of Radiology (ACR) published a white paper that presented a new risk-stratification system for classifying thyroid nodules on the basis of their appearance at ultrasonography (US). In ACR TI-RADS, points in five feature categories are summed to determine a risk level from TR1 to TR5. Recommendations for biopsy or US follow-up are based on the nodule's ACR TI-RADS level and its maximum diameter. The purpose of this article is to offer practical guidance on how to implement and apply ACR TI-RADS based on the authors' experience with the system.

## Essentials

- Reports need only provide structured descriptions of up to four nodules that warrant further attention.
- An initial overview scan facilitates selection of nodules for further attention.
- The position and shape of the solid component of nodules and solid nodules may influence management.

## Scanning Protocol and Labeling

ACR TI-RADS recommends formally reporting up to four thyroid nodules with the highest point totals. Because some sonographers perform most US studies in radiology practices in the United States, they are often the first ones to encounter nodules. Because it is often impractical for sonographers to obtain images and measure every nodule, they must become familiar with the criteria that determine which ones warrant further attention before implementing a radiologist.

### ACR TI-RADS Labeling

- **Essentials for Sonography**: 
  - Initial overview scanning to familiarize with nodules.
  - Structured description up to four nodules.
  - Implementation of standard scannings, such as zoom, focal zone, frequency, and gain settings.

- **Protocol Details**:
  - Align the ultrasound technique with the laboratory’s protocol.
  - Adequately document for each nodule, including adjustments necessary for capturing specific characteristics.

### Considerations for Report

- Document each nodule’s size relative to others.
- Incorporate features such as:
  - Acoustic identifiers.
  - Scanning variables (depth, gain).
  - Correlations with previous imaging when relevant.

## Feature Assignment: Improving Accuracy and Consistency

As noted previously, five feature categories form the cornerstone of ACR TI-RADS, and it is important to be as objective as possible in applying them. Some features are more straightforward than others—for example, it is usually not difficult to decide whether a nodule is hyperechoic or hypoechoic, but differentiating hypoechoic from markedly hypoechoic nodules may be more challenging. In this section, we offer guidance for the most problematic features in each category.

### Composition

In ACR TI-RADS, nodules classified as spongiform are not subject to further feature assignment and are treated as benign, with no further follow-up needed. Most investigators agree that spongiform refers to the presence of tiny small cysts that are akin to the fluid-filled spaces in a new sponge, but there is some controversy regarding how much of the nodule must have this appearance. The ACR TI-RADS reporting lexicon states that at least 50% of the nodule's volume should be occupied by tiny cysts (Fig 3). 

Additionally, nodules that cannot be classified as spongiform still are often assigned benign status.

- **Figure 3**: Spongiform 0.9-cm nodule in a 59-year-old woman, where more than 50% of the nodule is composed of small cystic spaces.

### Distinguishing Solid from Cystic

Distinguishing solid nodules from cystic is also important and serves to guide further evaluation steps.

## Figures and Descriptions

### Figure 4
- Sagittal sonogram of a 4-6 cm benign cold nodule in a 65-year-old woman.
- Classified as solid (composition score of 2), although small cystic components were present.
- With 1 more point for hypoechogenicity and none in other categories, its point total was 3 (TR3).

### Figure 5
- Mixed cystic and solid papillary cancer in a 39-year-old man.
- Has a lobulated solid mural component with punctate echogenic foci (PEF).
- The nodule received 1 point for composition, 1 for its isoechoic solid component, and 3 for PEF, for a total of 5 (TR4).

### Figure 6
- Benign mixed cystic and solid nodule (1 point) in a 40-year-old woman.
- The 1-point isoechoic solid component is distributed around the periphery.
- The nodule received 2 points (TR2).

### Figure 7
- Transverse sonogram shows a 2.0-cm markedly hypoechoic papillary carcinoma (arrows) in a 24-year-old woman.
- The nodule received 2 points for solid composition and 3 for marked hypoechogenicity, totaling 5 points (TR4).

## Echogenicity
Assigning echogenicity by using the adjacent thyroid parenchyma as a frame of reference is usually straightforward. However, relative reflectivity may vary considerably depending on scanning parameters, particularly gain, transmit frequency, compression, and pre- and postprocessing. When in doubt, we find it helpful to consider echogenicity in multiple planes if possible. Real-time images are usually better than multiple stored images because hypoechoic and isoechoic nodules look very similar on 2D projections. High spatial resolution can improve accuracy.

Overall, the appearance of the solid component helps determine management. Features such as punctate echogenic foci or calcifications increase nodules’ suspicion levels. Nodules with suspicious solid tissue that are too small to warrant FNA require US follow-up, lessening the likelihood that important malignancy will remain undetected long term. Solid component visibility and the frame they are incorporated into are crucial.

## Figures and Descriptions

### Figure 8
- Transverse sonogram of a taller-than-wide papillary cancer in a 47-year-old man.
- In addition to 3 points for shape, the nodule was rated 2 points for solid composition, 1 point for isoechogenicity, and 3 points for numerous punctate echogenic foci, for a total of 9 points (TR5).

### Figure 9
- Transverse sonogram in a 52-year-old woman shows a benign follicular nodule with a smooth margin (arrows).
- The nodule was assigned 2 points for solid composition and 1 for isoechogenicity, for a total of 3 points (TR3).

### Figure 10
- **a.** Sagittal image of a 2.2-cm carcinoma in a 61-year-old man shows a lobulated margin (arrows), a 2-point feature.
- The nodule also received 2 points for solid composition and 2 for hypoechogenicity, for a total of 6 points (TR4).
- **b.** Sagittal sonogram of a 1.2 cm carcinoma with an irregular (spiculated) margin in a 39-year-old woman.
- In addition to 2 points for its margin type, the nodule was assigned 2 points for solid composition, 3 points for very low echogenicity, and 3 points for punctate echogenic foci, for a total of 10 points (TR5).

### Figure 11
- Papillary carcinoma bulging the thyroid border in a 24-year-old woman.
- No invasion was demonstrated at surgery.
- The nodule received 2 points for solid composition, 2 for hypoechogenicity, 3 for taller-than-wide shape, and 2 for a lobulated margin. Its point total was 9 (TR5).

## Margin
- A nodule's margin, defined as the character of its interface with adjacent intra- or extrathyroidal tissue, is best appreciated along its anterior border, which is orthogonal to the ultrasound beam.
- A smooth margin is characterized by an even, gradually curving interface.
- Infiltration, angulation, or intrusion of the nodule’s solid component into the surrounding tissue should be classified as lobulated or irregular, both warranting 2 points, so it is important to distinguish them.
- Extrathyroidal extension is a 3-point feature that is characterized by clear-cut invasion of adjacent structures.

## Echogenic Foci
- Macrocalcifications and peripheral calcifications can present diagnostic problems, as they are usually associated with some degree of mechanical shadowing.
- However, PEF, which may represent psammoma bodies in papillary cancers, are less straightforward.
- Many PEF are postparenchymal, and all types reflect the back walls of minute cysts.

## Figures and Descriptions

### Figure 12
- Sonogram of the left thyroid lobe in a 42-year-old man.
- Minute bright dots representing the speckle pattern of normal or nonmalignant tissue should not be misinterpreted as punctate echogenic foci.

### Figure 13
- Small comet-tail artifacts and additional echogenic foci (punctate echogenic foci [PEF]) in a papillary carcinoma in a 54-year-old woman.
- In addition to 3 points for PEF, the nodule was assigned 2 points for solid composition, 2 for hypoechogenicity, and 2 for a lobulated margin, for a total of 9 points (TR5).

## Measuring Nodules: How to Reduce Errors
- ACR TI-RADS recommends measuring nodules’ longest axis and the axis perpendicular to the longest axis on a transverse sonogram; the third measurement is on a sagittal image.
- Measurements usually lie parallel or perpendicular to the sound beam.

### Reporting Considerations
- Reports of thyroid sonograms should include:
  1. Tridimensional measurements of the right and left lobes and the anteroposterior dimension of the isthmus.
  2. A description of the top four suspicious nodules.
  3. Recommendations for management.

### Notes
- Accuracy may be compromised by transducer selection and variability from high spatial resolution.
- Improved resolution requires smaller measurements to observe how they were measured.
- Measurements should be repeated with thorough attention to how the nodules were contoured.
- A lack of standardization in measurement may result in variability due to high-frequency linear transducers.

Recognizing that patients are increasingly able to view imaging reports through portals and other means, it is noted that they may be concerned when an ACR TI-RADS module described as “moderately suspicious” will not be sampled for biopsy or followed up. For this reason, radiologists may choose not to mention risk descriptors in reports.

By no means is it advocated to withhold information; rather, to avoid misinterpretation by patients who may not fully understand the difference in clinical importance between a moderately suspicious nodule and a similarly suspicious nodule on imaging. Alternatively, radiologists may report aggregate risks instead of individual risk ranges. It's also believed that radiologists should discuss reporting preferences with referring physicians to avoid misunderstandings.

Every report should note more formally reported nodules, along with recommendations for management, like FNA (Fine-Needle Aspiration), follow-up ultrasounds, or further actions. Clinical correlation is needed to determine the need for biopsy or medical advice. Endocrinologists and other related physicians should be expected to apply reasonable standards regarding decisions on whether to follow the radiologist’s recommendations. A highly suspicious nodule in a patient with a limited life expectancy or other issues may not require biopsy.

Conversely, patient or referring physicians can discover variant patterns from ACR TI-RADS guidelines. Factors like family history of thyroid cancer increase the likelihood of cancer, or patients requiring FNA for other reasons. Endocrinologists might choose to follow additional guidelines that have different thresholds. This involves making appropriate medical decisions.

ACR TI-RADS does not specify that at least one biopsy is enough for solid nodules, as medical circumstances may vary regarding issue sampling or nodules. While some may see reduced intervals or biopsy needs, the ACR TI-RADS does not encompass regional lymph nodes, but believes in a better assessment of nodes that help in determining a biopsy necessity in suspicious thyroid nodules. If a nodule is suspicious, but does not meet the size threshold for its ACR TI-RADS level, biopsies may be required or follow-up studies might be performed by the initial physician or through further guidance from previous findings.

ACR TI-RADS suggests that each decision should reflect clinical cases per guidelines from the American Thyroid Association (3).

### Growth and Follow-up

ACR TI-RADS draws from the American Thyroid Association guidelines, following meticulous and clinically essential procedures.

## Conclusion

The ACR TI-RADS risk-stratification system allows practitioners to determine whether thyroid nodules require biopsy, follow-up, or no further action based on their US appearance. Success demands close cooperation between radiologists and sonographers and understanding of the nuances and potential pitfalls of disease assessment. Attention to detail is paramount in reporting and making recommendations.

## LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

### Biparametric Prostate MR Imaging Protocol: Time to Revise PI-RADS Version 2?

**Editor:**

With great interest, we read the Letters to the Editor by Dr. Scialpi and colleagues (1) in the January 2018 issue and by Dr. Kaji and Imamura (2) in the February 2018 issue of Radiology commenting on the article by Dr. Kuhl et al in the July 2017 issue of Radiology (3) about a possible reduction in acquisition time of multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the prostate. In their letter, Dr. Kuhl and colleagues investigated the diagnostic accuracy of a shortened biparametric MR imaging protocol compared to the standard, involving specific evaluations using T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging. The editors reviewed this approach for detection performance enhancement in prostate cancer diagnosis.

Further, Dr. Scialpi and colleagues suggested spatial planes are essential for exact disease diagnosis. Drs. Kaji and Imamura stated patients were evaluated with favorable index test results when a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score of 3, 4, or 5 was present, focusing on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) evaluation. This assessment aids in positive examination results.

Our opinion, confirmed by available data, asserts biparametric MR imaging yields advantages over standard MRI by indicating significant lesions without elongating scan time, which directly impacts patient discomfort and cost factors. Prior evaluations endorsed thorough strategic assessments of T2-weighted imaging, considering all advantages and limitations affecting cancer diagnosis transition.

The PI-RADS version 2, inclusive of these imaging methods, offers significant improvements compared to previously standard error rates. Recent publications emphasize the non-necessity of DCE for various scenarios, reducing highly targeted approaches for inconsistent prostate conditions.
