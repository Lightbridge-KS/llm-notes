## Preface

As did the previous editions, this textbook presents a comprehensive account of sampling theory as it has been developed for use in sample surveys. It contains illustrations to show how the theory is applied in practice, and exercises to be worked by the student. The book will be useful both as a text for a course on sample surveys with the major emphasis on theory and for individual reading by the student.

The minimum mathematical equipment necessary to follow the great bulk of the material is a familiarity with algebra, especially relatively complicated algebraic expressions, plus a knowledge of probability for finite sample spaces, including combinatorial probabilities. The book presupposes an introductory statistics course that covers means and standard deviations, the normal, binomial, hypergeometric, and multinomial distributions, the central limit theorem, linear regression, and the simpler types of analyses of variance. Since much of classical sample survey theory deals with the distributions of estimators over the set of randomizations provided by the sampling plan, some knowledge of nonparametric methods is helpful.

The topics in this edition are presented in essentially the same order as in earlier editions. New sections have been included, or sections rewritten, primarily for one of three reasons: (1) to present introductions to topics (sampling plans or methods of estimation) relatively new in the field; (2) to cover further work done during the last 15 years on older methods, intended either to improve them or to learn more about their performance; and (3) to shorten, clarify, or simplify proofs given in previous editions.

New topics in this edition include the approximate methods developed for the difficult problem of attaching standard errors or confidence limits to nonlinear estimates made from the results of surveys with complex plans. These methods will be more and more needed as statistical analyses (e.g., regressions) are performed on the results. For surveys containing sensitive questions that some respondents are unlikely to be willing to answer truthfully, a new device is to represent the respondent with either the sensitive question or an innocuous question; the specific choice, made by randomization, is unknown to the interviewer. In some sampling problems it may seem economically attractive, or essential in countries with low sampling resources, to use two overlapping lists (for example, as they are called) to cover the complete population. The method of double sampling has been extended to cases where the objective is to compare the means.
