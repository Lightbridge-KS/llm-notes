In 2017, the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) Committee of the American College of Radiology (ACR) published a white paper that presented a new risk-stratification system for classifying thyroid nodules on the basis of their appearance at ultrasonography (US). In ACR TI-RADS, points in five feature categories are summed to determine a risk level from TR1 to TR5. Recommendations for biopsy or US follow-up are based on the nodule’s ACR TI-RADS level and its maximum diameter. The purpose of this article is to offer practical guidance on how to implement and apply ACR TI-RADS based on the authors’ experience with the system.

## Radiology: Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System

Radiologists who interpret thyroid ultrasonography (US) images frequently face the dilemma of how to report nodules, which are extremely common and overwhelmingly benign. The American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) aims to provide an easy-to-apply method for practitioners to determine management. This will improve consistency across practices and institutions and will benefit patients by applying guidelines that are based on evidence and consensus expert opinion.

### ACR TI-RADS

ACR TI-RADS is founded on the evaluation of US features in five categories—composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, and echogenic foci—in which each feature is assigned 0–3 points (Fig 1). Features in the first four categories each have a single score derived from mutually exclusive choices, whereas more than one feature may be present in the echogenic foci category. The nodule’s point total determines its risk level, which ranges from TR1 (benign) to TR5 (highly suspicious). In conjunction with the nodule’s maximum diameter, the TI-RADS level determines whether to recommend a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, a follow-up US examination, or no further action.

### Essentials

- Reports need only provide structured descriptions of up to four nodules that warrant further attention.
- An initial overview scan facilitates selection of nodules for further attention.
- The position and shape of the solid component of nodules and solid nodules may influence management.

### Scanning Protocol and Labeling

ACR TI-RADS recommends formally reporting up to four thyroid nodules with the highest point totals. Because sonographers perform most US studies in radiology practices in the United States, they are often the first ones to encounter nodules. It is often impractical for sonographers to obtain images of and measure every nodule; they must become familiar with the criteria that determine which ones warrant further attention before implementing ACR TI-RADS.

### Imaging Techniques

- Use of all sonographic, depth, gain, zoom, focal zone, frequency, pre- and postprocessing, dynamic range, frame averaging, compounding, and other parameters should be optimized.
- Real-time cine clips are very helpful to highlight certain features, notably comet-tail artifacts, which may become more or less conspicuous as the scanning plane traverses the nodule.

### Feature Assignment: Improving Accuracy and Consistency

As noted previously, five feature categories form the cornerstone of ACR TI-RADS, and so it is critical to be as objective as possible in applying them. Some features are more straightforward than others—for example, it is usually not difficult to decide whether a nodule is hyperechoic or hypoechoic, but differentiating hypoechoic from markedly hypoechoic nodules may be more challenging. In this section, we offer guidance for the most problematic features in each category. Readers may consult the ACR TI-RADS reporting lexicon white paper, which contains images illustrating many of these features.

### Composition

In ACR TI-RADS, nodules classified as spongiform are not subject to further feature assignment and are treated as benign, with no further follow-up needed. Most investigators agree that spongiform refers to the presence of very small cysts that are akin to the fluid-filled spaces in a wet sponge, but there is some controversy as to how much of the nodule must have this appearance to qualify. The ACR thyroid lexicon, at least 50% of the nodule’s volume should be occupied by tiny cysts (Fig 3). It should be possible to make this determination by observation; if the cystic components comprise less than 50%, the nodule should not be treated as spongiform. Additionally, the presence of other features such as peripheral calcifications or macrocalcifications, which are usually easy to recognize, means that a nodule should not be classified as spongiform. However, the small echogenic foci that represent the back walls of minute cysts should not be misinterpreted as echogenic foci. Nodules with shadowing calcifications that preclude assessment of their architecture are assumed to be solid and therefore receive 2 points for composition.

### Distinguishing solid nodules from mixed cystic and solid nodules may be difficult in practice, as they represent a continuum. Unlike most spongiform nodules, ACR TI-RADS does not require that the observed size of the cystic component of a nodule be tall, as just determining its often slightly heterogeneous is important than such characteristics of the component. This represents a departure from the lexicon, which explicitly describes predominantly solid nodules as predominantly solid nodules. As a general principle, however, otherwise solid nodules that contain small cystic components (usually 25% of the overall volume should be classified as solid). 

For nodules that contain more than minimal solid components and are not predominantly solid, they should be classified as mixed cystic and solid.

### Figure 5
- **Description:** Mixed cystic and solid papillary cancer in a 39-year-old man has a lobulated solid mural component with punctate echogenic foci (PEF). The nodule received 1 point for composition, 1 for its isoechoic solid component, and 3 for PEF, for a total of 5 (TR4).

### Figure 6
- **Description:** Benign mixed cystic and solid nodule (1 point) in a 40-year-old woman. The 1-point isoechoic solid component is distributed around the periphery. The nodule received 2 points (TR2).

### Figure 7
- **Description:** Transverse sonogram shows 2.0-cm markedly hypoechoic papillary carcinoma (arrows) in a 24-year-old woman. The nodule received 2 points for solid composition and 3 for marked hypoechogenicity, totaling 5 points (TR4).

## Echogenicity

- **Assessing Echogenicity:** Use the adjacent thyroid parenchyma as a frame of reference. Relative reflectivity may vary based on scanning parameters, gain, and pre- and post-processing.
- **When in Doubt:** Consider echogenicity in multiple planes. Real-time images are essential because hypoechoic and isoechoic nodules may look similar on static images.
- **Importance:** Differentiating hypoechoic from markedly hypoechoic nodules is crucial. Adjust scanning parameters to obtain images at various settings to facilitate management.

## Management Considerations

- **Solid Component Appearance:** Helps determine management. Features like punctate echogenic foci or calcifications increase suspicion.
- **Position and Shape:** Consider the location and symmetry of the solid material relative to the whole nodule.
- **Mural Nodules:** Isolated, masslike, and protrude into the lumen are more suspicious.
- **Solid Material:** Viable tissue rather than blood clots, debris, or necrotic tissue.

## Recommendations

- **FNA Considerations:** If the solid component is smaller than the size threshold for a completely solid nodule, FNA should be recommended.

## Measuring Nodules: How to Reduce Errors

ACR TI-RADS recommends measuring a nodule’s longest axis and the largest dimension perpendicular to the longest axis on a transverse (axial) image to obtain the largest cross-sectional dimension on a sagittal image. These measurements usually lie parallel or perpendicular to the sound beam, but they will be angled if the nodule is obliquely oriented. Regardless, nodules should be measured by using the same technique that was used in prior studies to assess growth, which may be based on changes in linear measurements or volume.

To improve consistency on follow-up examinations, sonographers/sonologists should review prior sonograms to determine which nodules may warrant continued attention and see how they were measured. Current US systems equipped with high-frequency linear array transducers achieve very high spatial resolution. In practice, however, measurement accuracy is hampered by interobserver variability that is chiefly related to poor border conspicuity. This limitation, which is largely due to the interface between the nodule and its surroundings, can be mitigated by meticulous technique, but not eliminated entirely.

As with other features, scanning parameters play an important role. Notably, settings that would be inappropriate for characterizing internal architecture may obfuscate the visibility of a nodule’s margin. For example, lowering the dynamic range or altering pre- and postprocessing settings may make it easier to distinguish the nodule from adjacent tissue, making it easier to tell where to place measurement calipers. Despite the imager’s best efforts, however, some nodules cannot be measured reliably if they are poorly defined and merge with their surroundings.

## Reporting Considerations

Reports of thyroid sonograms should include the following elements:

1. Tridimensional measurements of the right and left lobes and the anteroposterior dimension of the isthmus.
2. An overall description of the thyroid parenchyma.
3. Focal description of up to the four most suspicious nodules.
4. Recommendations for management.

Nodules not deemed formally may be mentioned in the overall description to avoid calling attention to them and stating that no warrant FNA for follow-up per ACR TI-RADS. The sole exception is when a US study is performed to evaluate a nodule that was palpated or detected at another imaging examination. Even if no nodules are suspicious, the nodule in question should be formally reported, along with any suspicious incidental nodules.

### Figures

**Figure 12:** Sonogram of the left thyroid lobe in a 42-year-old man. Minute bright dots representing the speckle pattern of normal or nonmalignant tissue (arrow) should not be misinterpreted as punctate echogenic foci.

**Figure 13:** Small comet-tail artifacts and additional echogenic foci (punctate echogenic foci [PEF]) in a papillary carcinoma in a 54-year-old woman. In addition to 3 points for PEF, the nodule was assigned 2 points for solid composition, 2 for hypoechogenicity, and 2 for a taller-than-wide shape, for a total of 9 points (TR5).

When this occurs, this limitation should be noted in the report.

The ACR TI-RADS system provides descriptors for each of the five suspicion levels: benign (TR1), not suspicious (TR2), mildly suspicious (TR3), moderately suspicious (TR4), and highly suspicious (TR5). In a recent study, these were associated with aggregate cancer risks of 0.3%, 1.5%, 4.8%, 9.1%, and 35.0%, respectively.

The ACR TI-RADS recommendations for FNA and follow-up were in part informed by the growing recognition that many thyroid cancers are indolent and unlikely to cause harm to patients during their lifetime. Nevertheless, we recognize that patients are increasingly able to view imaging reports through portals and other means and that they may be concerned that an 8-mm TR4 nodule described as “moderately suspicious” will not be sampled for biopsy or even followed up. For this reason, radiologists may elect not to mention the risk descriptors in reports.

By no means are we advocating withholding information; rather, we wish to avoid misinterpretation by patients who may not fully understand the difference in clinical importance between a moderately suspicious nodule and a similarly suspicious nodule many lesion. Alternatively, radiologists may report aggregate risks or risk ranges. We also believe that radiologists should discuss reporting preferences with referring physicians to avoid misunderstandings.

Every report that includes one or more formally reported nodules must also provide recommendations for management, whether FNA, follow-up US, or no further action. We believe that statements such as “clinical correlation is needed to determine the need for biopsy” should be avoided. Endocrinologists and other referring physicians should be expected to apply reasonable standards of care regarding decisions whether to follow the radiologist’s recommendations. For example, a highly suspicious nodule in a patient with a limited life expectancy or other issues may not require biopsy.

Conversely, patient or referring physician preferences may act as variant guidelines from the strict ACR TI-RADS guidelines. Patients with a personal or family history that increases the likelihood of cancer, or patients who are highly concerned for other reasons, may require FNA and/or follow-up of nodules that fall below ACR TI-RADS size thresholds. This involves the radiologist in shared decision making that is appropriate for effective medical care. Similarly, ACR TI-RADS recommends FNA of more than two nodules in one gland, but circumstances may rarely require tissue sampling of more than three.

ACR TI-RADS does not encompass regional lymph nodes, but we believe that at least a brief assessment of nodes may be helpful in determining the need for biopsy in the setting of thyroid nodules. This practice is in keeping with scanning protocols from professional organizations. If a node has a suspicious appearance, but there are no thyroid nodules that warrant FNA, the node should be sampled. In some patients, it may be appropriate to biopsy a suspicious nodule that does not meet the size threshold for its ACR TI-RADS level. A comprehensive evaluation of nodes is required in patients known to have, or suspected of having thyroid cancer. It may be performed at the time of the initial thyroid US examination, in conjunction with a US-guided biopsy, or as a separate procedure. Lymph node evaluation after a cancer diagnosis has been made with biopsy.

ACR TI-RADS does not specify what is recommended for nodules that have been sampled previously. Radiologists may defer decisions regarding follow-up US or repeat FNA to referring physicians, who may have information regarding previous biopsy results that are unavailable to the radiologist interpreting a thyroid sonogram. Decisions regarding the need for repeat biopsy should be guided by the referring physician based on guidelines from the American Thyroid Association or other professional groups.

It is also important to recognize that in benign nodules many patients will elect to undergo a follow-up biopsy, causing them to appear more suspicious, complex, or calcified. These so-called indeterminate nodules will have a higher ACR TI-RADS score, but such nodules should be approached more conservatively and should be safely followed with US rather than repeat FNA, regardless of their score.

## Conclusion

The ACR TI-RADS risk-stratification system allows practitioners to determine whether thyroid nodules require biopsy, follow-up, or no further action based on their US appearance. Success demands close cooperation between radiologists and sonographers, understanding of the nuances and pitfalls of feature assessment, and attention to detail in reporting and making recommendations.

**Editor:**  
With great interest, we read the Letters to the Editor by Dr. Scialpi and colleagues (1) in the January 2018 issue of Radiology and by Dr. Kaji and Imamaru (2) in the February 2018 issue of Radiology commenting on the article by Dr. Kuhl et al in the July 2017 issue of Radiology (3) about a possible reduction in acquisition time of multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the prostate. In particular, Dr. Kuhl and colleagues investigated the diagnostic accuracy of a shortened biparametric MR imaging protocol comprising the sole evaluation of axial T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging. The authors showed that this approach led to a similar diagnostic performance in the detection of prostate lesions compared with the standard multiparametric MR imaging protocol. In the first letter, Dr. Scialpi and colleagues (1) pointed out that the acquisition of spatial and coronal T2-weighted images could make it difficult to measure both prostate and lesion volume, as well as to perform targeted biopsy when using fusion software to localize prostate lesions. Furthermore, Dr. Scialpi and colleagues suggested that the spatial plane is essential for the assessment of extraprostatic disease. On the other hand, Drs. Kaji and Imamaru pointed out that, in the article by Dr. Kuhl and colleagues, patients were considered having a positive index test result when they had a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score of 3, 4, or 5 (2–3). In this setting, considering that dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) evaluation allows only for an upgrade of PI-RADS scores from 3 to 4 (4), it is clear that its possible contribution to a correct diagnostic assessment is not significant. Our opinion, which is consistent with data available in the literature, is that biparametric MR imaging offers clear and significant advantages over standard multiparametric MR imaging, providing a similar diagnostic accuracy but leading to a significant reduction of acquisition time, which is directly related to both patient discomfort and costs (5). Future studies are strongly warranted to better identify and evaluate well-established strategies in combination of T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging, considering all advantages and disadvantages of their combination. However, to upgrade to PI-RADS version 2, the role of MR spectroscopy and DCE imaging was already reappraised and reduced, and at the time further concerns regarding the usefulness of DCE were raised (6). In light of the recently published articles on shortened biparametric MR imaging prostate protocols (3,5,7), our opinion is that DCE should no longer be considered mandatory and its role further evaluated within a new and up-to-date version of PI-RADS.
